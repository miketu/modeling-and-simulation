Exercise 0. You should consult the following tutorials for a quick intro and basic help:

Exercise 1. The graduated income tax is a concept where people of different incomes are taxed differently.

Program a calculator for different income tax rates using R:
Income	Amount Taxed
0-20k	0%
20k-50k	10% of amount over 20,000
50k-70k	15% of amount over 50,000
70k-90k	20% of amount over 70,000
90k-110k	25% of amount over 90,000
110k+	30% of amount over 110,000

For example, if I was to make 80k, I would be taxed at the rate of 10% for the 20-50k amount plus the 15% for the 50-70k amount plus 20% of the amount over 70,000 . 

Exercise 2. Now building on problem 2, turn this into a function.

Exercise 3. Now generalize problem 2 to do this calculator for a whole list of values… so for example if I had a list of c(100k, 550k, 50k, 10k), write code that could output a corresponding list where the tax calculation was applied to the whole list.

Exercise 4. Create a dataframe structure to encapsulate the following data.  

| Name    | Gender | Job          |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Adam    | M      | Engineer     |
| Bob     | M      | Poet         |
| Cynthia | F      | Scientist    |
| David   | M      | Data Analyst |
| Elisa   | F      | Teacher      |

Exercise 5.

| Job           | Salary |
|---------------|--------|
| Data Analyst  |  80000 |
| Poet          |  30000 |
| Teacher       |  50000 |
| Engineer      |  90000 |
| Nurse         |  80000 |
| Auto Mechanic |  74000 |
| Scientist     |  89000 |


How can I combine this dataframe with the dataframe from #5? So I can have the numbers corresponding to the job added to the dataframe with people’s names on it? 

Exercise 6.  Apply the function from Problem #3 onto the table and create a column that calculates “Taxes Paid”.
Exercise 7. Turn your job table into an excel file using R, or make it a simple database to query. Research the merits of different databases.
