** What is Modeling and Simulation?
*** Definitions
- Modeling is the practice of simplifying, formulating, and evaluating real world systems with mathematical reasoning and computer simulation. 
- Analysis is the practice of evaluating system properties based on measurements (relates to "inverse problem", "statistics", "inference")
- Criteria of mathematics include [[https://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/][Abstraction/Simplification]], Arguments from scale/proportionality (see Albright - Mathematical Modeling in Excel), dimensional analysis coherency, internal logical coherency, coherency with existing mathematical and physical theorems, beauty, prediction ability
- "Mathematics is the study of pure pattern" - Rudy Rucker (Mind Tools)
- "Engineering is the purposeful use of science" - Stephen Senturia

- "Higher Mathematics is the art of reasoning about the numerical relations between natural phenomena; and the several sections of higher Mathematics are different modes of viewing these relations" - Mellor
- "this is the purpose of chemical science, to describe in the simplest possible manner the phenomena associated with matter in the act of changing. The word "describe" has been selected with deliberation. The more important advances of modern science have been achieved by keeping the descriptive, not the causal, relations of phenomena constantly in view. Work only progresess along the natural path of experiment and observation. In consequence, "why" is rapidly disappearing from our vocabularly" - Mellor (Chemical Statics and Dynamics)
- "The search for the first cause has been relinquished. "How?" is the direct object of attack. Our relate "how," now "why", phenomena occur. A phenomena is explained by showing how it resembles something already known. Newton's celebrated law epitomises in one simple statement how bodies have always been observed to fall in the past. ... The scientific generalization explains the operations of Nature by showing the elements of sameness in what, at first site, appears to be a confused jumble of phenomena. Generalization is the golden thread which binds many facts togther in one simple description. " - Mellor (Chemical Statics and Dynamics)
- "The verbal description of the hypothesis, the differential equation, and the integral, are three different ways of stating one concept. A clear physical view must precede the application of mathematics." - Mellor
- "There is a prevailing notion that the agreement between the "calculated" and "observed" results is an infalliable crucial test of any hypothesis. The agreement only shows that the hypothesis may be true. G.W. Von Leibnitz long ago remarked that success in explaining facts is no proof of the validity of an hypothesis." - Mellor
- "The philosopher may be delighted with the extent of his views, the artificer with the readiness of his hands, but let one remember that without mechanical performance, refined speculation is an empty dream, and the other that without theoretical reasoning, dexterity is little more than brute instinct" - Samuel Johnson (from Mellor)
- "Any difficult that might arise is rather due to the complicated nature of the phenomena alone. A.Comte has said in his Philosophie Positive, 'our feeble minds can no longer trace the logical consequences of the laws of natural phenomena whenever we attempt to simultaneously include more than two or three essential factors" In consequence it is generally found expedient to introduce "simplifying assumptions" into the mathematical analysis. - Mellor
- "Logic and mathematics are both mere tools by which 'the decisions of the mind are worked out with accuracy' but both must be directed by the mind" - Mellor
- "It is only after the different works have "collected data" that the mathematician is able to deduce the require generalization. Thus a Maxwell followed Faraday, and a Newton completed Kepler" - Mellor
- "It must not be supposed, however, that these remarks are intended to imply that a law of Nature has been represented by a mathematical expression with perfect exactness. In the best of generalizations, hypothetical conditions invariably replace the complex state of things which actually obtains in Nature" - Mellor
- "With improved instruments, and better methods of measurement, more accurate data are from time to time available. The errors of observation being thus reduced, the approximate nature of the formulae becomes more and more apparent. Ultimate, the discrepancy between theory and fact becomes too great to be ignored. It is then neccessary to "go over to the fundamentals". New Formulae must be obtained emobody less of hypothesis, more of fact. Thus, from the first bold guess of an original mind, succeeding generlations progress step by step towards a comprehensive and a complete formulation of the several laws of Nature" - Mellor
- "Higher Mathematics is the art of reasoning about the numerical relations between natural phenomena; and the several sections of higher Mathematics are different modes of viewing these relations" - Mellor
- "this is the purpose of chemical science, to describe in the simplest possible manner the phenomena associated with matter in the act of changing.

*** Why is Simulation Neccessary?
- Some problems can't currently be solved with mathematical reasoning only, consequently, we "brute-force" problems and automate multiple small calculations
  - Example.  [[https://evgenii.com/blog/three-body-problem-simulator/][3 Body Problem]]
  - Example. Navier-Stokes and Computational Fluid Dynamics
  - Example. Molecular dynamics
  - Example. Finite element analysis



- A computer is good at storing information and performing basic calculations. Modern computers start from "digital logic" circuits and then build up to  complex systems ([[https://www.nand2tetris.org/][link]]). Handling layers of language abstraction and cleverly designing systems is a huge part of "Computer Science" and "Software Engineering"

*** The bridge between mathematics and reality

There are a number of tools that can be used to illustrate mathematics in a "physical" way. I think this is a ripe field of exploration "manipulables" that can be used to help us get a connection between "book mathematics" and the physical reality we live in. 

Examples
  - Abacus
  - Slide Rule

  - Integrator device

** Analogies between Fields

A number of books I've read have presented analogies between many mechanical, electrical, fluidic, and thermal forces. I've yet to see a comprehensive and easy to read treatment, so I've written down some notes for now:
