** What is Engineering Modeling and Analysis?
*** Definitions
- Modeling is the practice of simplifying, formulating, and evaluating real world systems with mathematical reasoning and computer simulation. 
- Analysis is the practice of evaluating system properties based on measurements (relates to "inverse problem", "statistics", "inference")
- "Mathematics is the study of pure pattern" - Rudy Rucker (Mind Tools)
- "Engineering is the purposeful use of science" - Stephen Senturia

*** Criteria of Mathematics include
  - [[https://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/][Abstraction/Simplification]]
  - Arguments from Scale/Proportionality (see Albright - Mathematical Modeling)
  - Dimensional Analysis
  - Beauty
  - Prediction ability


*** Why is Simulation Neccessary?
- Some problems can't currently be solved with mathematical reasoning only, consequently, we "brute-force" problems and automate multiple small calculations
  - Example.  [[https://evgenii.com/blog/three-body-problem-simulator/][3 Body Problem]]
  - Example. Navier-Stokes and Computational Fluid Dynamics
  - Example. Molecular dynamics
  - Example. Finite element analysis



- A computer is good at storing information and performing basic calculations. Modern computers start from "digital logic" circuits and then build up to  complex systems ([[https://www.nand2tetris.org/][link]]). Handling layers of language abstraction and cleverly designing systems is a huge part of "Computer Science" and "Software Engineering"

  - Water Adder
  - Minecraft computers
  - Analog Computers and Op-Amps for doing Calculus

*** The bridge between mathematics and reality

There are a number of tools that can be used to illustrate mathematics in a "physical" way. I think this is a ripe field of exploration "manipulables" that can be used to help us get a connection between "book mathematics" and the physical reality we live in. 

Examples
  - Abacus
  - Slide Rule
  - [[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iWVGiFOuhQA][Derivimeter]]
  - Integrator device

** Analogies between Fields

A number of books I've read have presented analogies between many mechanical, electrical, fluidic, and thermal forces. I've yet to see a comprehensive and easy to read treatment, so I've written down some notes for now:
