** What is Engineering Modeling and Analysis?
*** Definitions
- Modeling is the practice of simplifying, formulating, and evaluating real world systems with mathematical reasoning and computer simulation. 
- Analysis is the practice of evaluating system properties based on measurements (relates to "inverse problem", "statistics", "inference")
- "Mathematics is the study of pure pattern" - Rudy Rucker (Mind Tools)
- "Engineering is the purposeful use of science" - Stephen Senturia

*** Criteria of Mathematics include
  - [[https://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/][Abstraction/Simplification]]
  - Arguments from Scale/Proportionality (see Albright - Mathematical Modeling)
  - Dimensional Analysis
  - Beauty
  - Prediction ability


*** Why is Simulation Neccessary?
- Some problems can't currently be solved with mathematical reasoning only, consequently, we "brute-force" problems and automate multiple small calculations
  - Example.  [[https://evgenii.com/blog/three-body-problem-simulator/][3 Body Problem]]
  - Example. Navier-Stokes and Computational Fluid Dynamics
  - Example. Molecular dynamics
  - Example. Finite element analysis



- A computer is good at storing information and performing basic calculations. Modern computers start from "digital logic" circuits and then build up to  complex systems ([[https://www.nand2tetris.org/][link]]). Handling layers of language abstraction and cleverly designing systems is a huge part of "Computer Science" and "Software Engineering"
